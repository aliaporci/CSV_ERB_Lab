Good news Rubyists!
We have a week of records tracking what we shipped at Planet Express. I need you to answer a few questions for Hermes.

How much money did we make this week?
How much of a bonus did each employee get? (bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express)
How many trips did each employee pilot?
Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to

Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn’t allowed into space)
Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)
Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee…)
Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one
They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus

And so: We need sections on the HTML with:

h1 with the total money we made this week
List of all Shipments (create a table with the shipments listed)
List of all employees and their number of trips and bonus
A gif, preferably related to Fry, Amy, Bender, and/or Leela
